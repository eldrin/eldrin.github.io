I am currently a Ph.D. candidate from Multimedia Computing Group of TU Delft, whose main interest is in the music information retrieval and recommender systems. Also, I am a musician who used to be active freelancer composer for years. I started my academic journey with the literature and linguistics in my bachelor with the passion for learning how most brilliant human minds of history could achieve such great works. Along with it, I studied subjects on the information and culture technology, where I learned how the engineering interacts with contemporary cultural achievements. I continued to study further how music technology works, from [Music and Audio Research Group]('marg.snu.ac.kr'). Started to be more into the information retrieval and machine learning techniques applied in music domain, I flew to the Netherlands, to seek my current position.

I am an open person and willing to collaborate either research or music :)
